## Project Description
              
## Workflow
- After downloading and giving the shark attacks data a quick review, I explored the site it came from to see what kind of input they were using. Turns out entries can be submitted via form with many text fields.
- I set up a jupyter notebook. Within in the notebook I commented on what I was doing and why I thought it necessary.
- Without knowing enough about the data and with no particular goal in mind, my first idea was to eliminate any 'mess'. These were columns or rows I believed to offer no helpful information, because they just did not have any input.
- I refrained from dropping the case_no_1 and case_no_2 columns, because I figured they might be useful documentation (even though they meant nothing to me).
- I renamed most of the columns to get rid of whitespace, slashes and dots.
- Due to time constraints I was not able to implement all the changes I would have liked, but I did enjoy myself.

## Organization
I used Trello to keep track of what I am doing. My repo only contains the one directory.
